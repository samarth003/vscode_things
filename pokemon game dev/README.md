# Pokemon console game development concept
## REGISTRATION
If a new pokemon trainer comes in to Professor's lab for registration - 
1. First name
2. Last name
3. Township 
From Township, it will be identified in which region trainer is starting their journey. 
Every region will have some townships/cities that will be in the database. 
Once registration is complete, *trainer information* should be stored in the trainer database
If the trainer wants to withdraw anytime, they should be able to do so and their information from *trainer database* will be deleted 

## Trainer database
It should consist of the following information - 
1. Trainer's name 
2. Trainer's township or city where they live and registered from
3. Trainer's pokemon **Need to investigate this more**
